## Business Problem

In the lending sector, financial institutions must decide which borrowers to approve while minimizing the risk of loan defaults. This project is designed for risk analysts and lending managers who need data-driven insights to make better credit decisions. The core challenge is identifying high-risk borrowers early, using historical loan and borrower data. By analyzing patterns in credit behavior, this system helps improve approval strategies and reduce financial losses.

**Core Business Question**

> How can we identify high-risk borrowers before loan approval to minimize default rates and financial losses?

**Decision Supported**

> This analysis enables stakeholders to decide whether to approve, reject, or modify loan applications by assessing the borrower’s default risk, allowing for more informed and risk-aware lending decisions.

## Analytical Pipeline

The project follows a structured 7-step workflow:

1. **Define** - Sector selected, problem statement scoped, mentor approval obtained.
2. **Extract** - Raw dataset sourced and committed to `data/raw/`; data dictionary drafted.
3. **Clean and Transform** - Cleaning pipeline built in `notebooks/02_cleaning.ipynb` and optionally `scripts/etl_pipeline.py`.
4. **Analyze** - EDA and statistical analysis performed in notebooks `03` and `04`.
5. **Visualize** - Interactive Tableau dashboard built and published on Tableau Public.
6. **Recommend** - 3-5 data-backed business recommendations delivered.
7. **Report** - Final project report and presentation deck completed and exported to PDF in `reports/`.
